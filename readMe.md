# An extension of the Unified Skew-Normal family of distributions and application to Bayesian binary regression

This repository is linked to the article [Onorati and Liseo (2023). *An extension of the Unified Skew-Normal family of distributions and application to Bayesian binary regression*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03474) and provides the code for the R package `pSUN`.

There are also the codes implementing the empirical examples of the article including the execution `*`.Rout files. `*`.RData were excluded for memory space limit.

Notice that the package `pSUN` requires the following dependencies:

* GIGrvg
* TruncatedNormal
* matrixStats
* nleqslv
* statmod
* truncnorm

Furthermore, the following packages are required for obtaining the final results:

* sns
* arm
* nlme
* boot
* xtable
* matrixStats

To obtain the figures and tables run <name_of_example>_getResults.R
